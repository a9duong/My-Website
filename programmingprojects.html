			<p>This site was my first attempt to enter the web development world. I learned from various sources on the internet, mainly 
			learning from Codeacademy then using references to enhance my knowledge. The site is built using HTML, CSS with the Bootstrap framework.</p>
			<p>I am currently learning javascript with some files behind the scenes that contain game experiments, but I currently have no javascript 
			on the site.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4"><h2>Pong Clone</h2>
	<p> Since I haven't had much experience, I felt that making a pong clone would be appropriate to help me get a better feel of C++. Although
it is a pong clone, I am trying to add in extras such as power ups and certain customizations. Will upload my prototype on GitHub soon.</p>
